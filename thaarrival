<p>After being sucked into a black hole of dealing with internet trolls I decided to pull a movie out of my limited collection, sorry for the old movies but I do not have access to Netflix or other streaming services and live a distance from a movie theater. I decide to watch  the Arrival which can be described as a first contact movie. First contact refers to when humans first encounters aliens from another planet, movies like Contact, Independence Day, Star Trek:First Contact and Close Encounters of the Third Kind can probably go into this category. This category is interesting because it not only what the aliens will do but how we will react to the fact we are not alone in the universe. There will probably be several different reactions to this fact, to the people who think it is just a matter of time and some of which are looking for the aliens probably be happy for a while until some realize they probably be out of a job and these people will be cautious but generally welcoming to the the experience. The reaction that could be troubling is the people who think we are the only intelligent life in the universe Some will think that is fake or a conspiracy, thinking that the people who found the aliens are looking for money to keep their research going or to force theory values on the world. Some of these people could be violent to the alien supporters or to the aliens directly. There are some people having who fight tooth and nail about the chances of life in the universe by going well we have not found that many Earths or planets are not around the right type of star or too close or too far away. The Kepler mission did not find an Earth in a similar orbit is that  the gyros failed after 2 years into its mission and you need more than 2 orbits to conform its orbit, there have been studies to find things like a starspots, flares and that might mimic a planet.</p>

<p>One criticism in the movie and in real life is that the military take charge of the many of the 12 landing sites that the aliens in the movie appear. This is not such a concern for me because the military seems like the logical group in most cases for this because they would have the infrastructure to create the facility to support such a mission. Most of the military is actual support units such as engineers, doctors, truck drivers and cooks. Plus they usually have the gear needed already in bases throughout whatever country they are in, the US army has stuff like C.S.H  (Combat  Surgical Hospital pronounced cash)a  the descendent of the MASH units that I think there was a sitcom based off of, and probably other units that can be deployed in a hurry. Plus they can defend us from the aliens, probably not for long, or us from the aliens or any possible transfer of diseases. </p>

<p>The aliens in the movie speak a language unlike any language on Earth and they require a specialist in that field to find a way to communicate with them also with a astrophysicists to find out how they were able to get to Earth. The aliens themselves a giant 7 footed creatures that exist in a different environment then the humans and able to emit a black floating ink that they use to write circles that represent words or concepts. During the movie there is a problem with the the translation that everyone thinks they were going to use a weapon or give a weapon and it is actually meant to be the gift of their language. To completely to understand their language we have to change our understanding our understanding of time. This change in the understanding in time will give us a better understanding of physics. This might help be in helping to overcome the hurtles in string theory and might lead to things like anti-gravity, new elements, and communications over large distances. In the movie these aliens give the gift because they will need humans in three thousand years, it is not said in the movie but it might take this amount of time for the humans to catch up.</p>

<p>There is a subplot in the movie that deals with the linguist Louise and astrophysicist Ian eventually get married after the events of the movie and have a daughter Hannah. The scenes in Hannah's life are not seen in a linear time line and are seen throughout the movie and Louise knows what happens to Hannah even before Hannah is born. Which brings up interesting questions about if you know what will happen good or bad. Will you still do it even if ends in tragedy, my answer depends on the situation is, yes, a persons life might end before it should but you don't know how that life will effect others around that person. The title of the book the movie is based from is “The Story of your Life.” Which probably more dealt with the life of the girl than the the move. The Movie in generally will suck you in and the 2 hours for me went fast, and the movie is very thought provoking with not that much action in the movie. If you have not seen it go and watch it. </p>
